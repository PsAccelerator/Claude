# Assets Directory

This directory is for files that will be used in the final report output, such as:

- Templates (e.g., report_template.docx, presentation_template.pptx)
- Logos and branding assets
- Boilerplate content
- Icons and images for reuse

These files are NOT meant to be loaded into context, but rather copied or referenced when creating reports.

## Example Assets You Might Add

- Company logo (logo.png)
- Report templates (analysis_template.docx)
- Chart templates
- Boilerplate text files
